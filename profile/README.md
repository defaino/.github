DeFaino Protocol

Welcome to our GitHub organization, where we specialize in creating a innovative decentralised lendig platform for digital assets!

DeFaino is a decentralised protocol built on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) which allows securely to supply and to borrow assets. Protocol has functionality of flexible adjustable interest rates when supply rate is growing with growth of pool utilisation.

DeFaino is better than competitors providing per second interest rate calculation. While competitors have per block time expression which is less accurate.

Another outstanding protocol feature is flexible distribution of governance token rewards between borrow and supply side of the protocol. DeFaino automatically increases rewards on supply side when protocol needs liquidity but when pool utilisation ratio is low, the protocol stimulates borrowing by higher rewards on borrowing side.

Protocol has a stable coin module which none of competitors have. This module allows protocol to issue its own stable coin with a fixed interest rate set by protocol governance. Stable coin is issued under collateral assets deposited in liquidity pools providing solid backing for every issued stable coin.

DeFaino is a bank on blockchain. Advantages of decentralised protocol nature is security of funds deposited in liquidity pools. Protocol Smart Contracts has a security audit which ensures that it is not possible to acquire deposited funds in a wrong way. All loans are more than 100% secured by collateral assets. 

Key Lending Protocol Functionality:
- Supply list of assets with no limits on amount
- Withdraw supplied assets with additional interest accrued
- Borrow assets under supplied collateral
- Repay assets with additional interest
- If collateral ratio is exceeding 100% (borrowed more than allowed) the position will be liquidated by third party, loan will be partially repaid, collateral will be withdrawn by the third party
